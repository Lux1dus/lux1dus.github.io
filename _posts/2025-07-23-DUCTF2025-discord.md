## Room recap:
**Discord** was a relatively easy and straightforward challenge. I believe its main purpose was to help players familiarize themselves with the flag format used in DUCTF2025. To solve it, all you had to do was find the correct chatroom on the official DownUnderCTF 2025 Discord server anddd flag secured.

## Key Takeaways

🧠 Got familiar with the flag format used in DUCTF2025

🧠 Learned how to use Discord’s search functionality

💯 Earned an easy 100 points to kick things off!

## Ight. Let's do this!

First, with the hint suggesting that the flag is hidden somewhere in DUCTF's Discord server, the first step was to find the link to that server.

After jumping between different tabs on the CTF website, I finally located the Discord invite link right on the homepage when first accessing the platform.

> This writeup was made after the CTF ended so that's why there's a "Thanks for Playing!"
{: .prompt-tip }

After joining the server via the given link, I was greeted with a wide range of chat channels inside.

I then tried using Discord’s search function to hunt down the flag, hoping someone had leaked or mentioned it somewhere… but sadly, nothing useful turned up.

Eventually, I gave up on searching and decided to go full *ooga-booga* mode, manually clicking through each channel one by one. And voilà!
The flag was hiding in plain sight, tucked away in the **#sponsors** channel as an image.
